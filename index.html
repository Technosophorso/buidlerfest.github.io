      <h2>Day 1 :: Presentations</h2>
      <p>
        Focused on demos, project presentations and techniques. No keynotes, no
        vendor booths. Only builders living the moment and many opportunities
        for the Cardano community to showcase its amazing work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you a developer who enjoys writing code? Want to learn or share some
        coding techniques? Want to discuss the latest smart-contract development
        trends? Do you prefer fiddling with infrastructure? Are you designing
        user interfaces for DApps?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the time. Whether you want to give a talk, run a workshop, or
        organize something lighter,
        <a href="/register/speakers">call for speakers</a> awaits
        you.
      </p>

      <h2>Day 2 :: Open Space</h2>
      <p>
        Hands-on! We'll start the day with a big Open Space and co-create the
        track for the day.
      </p>
      <p>Feel like hacking on something for a day?</p>
      <p>
        Or perhaps, contributing to some open-source project(s) of the
        ecosystem?
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be ours to decide and to collectively design the day. Three
        working spaces will be available to let the magic happen. Make sure to
        bring your gears.
