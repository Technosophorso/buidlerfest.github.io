        The idea of organising a recurring event where people interested in the
        <em>practical</em> aspects of Cardano could congregate and learn, share,
        talk together occured to us while
        <a href="https://twitter.com/_KtorZ_">Matthias</a> and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_c0d3">I</a>, along with
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ch1bo_">ch1bo</a> were working on Hydra
        back in 2023. Unsurprisingly, this is a sentiment that has been shared
        by many other developers in the Cardano community as it&#39;s been
        visible on social media:

          <br /><br />Best investment into the ecosystem that you could possibly
          make. <br /><br />It would accelerate everything, give people new
          ideas &amp; let them learn from each other.<br /><br />Make it purely
          technical,â€¦

      <p>
        There already exists events like the
        <a href="https://summit.cardano.org">Cardano Summit</a>,
        <a href="https://rareevo.io">RareEvo</a> or
        <a href="https://cnftcon.io/">NFTxLV</a> which are aimed at a more
        general audience, and meant to raise awareness about Cardano, attract
        business developers, investors, startupers to foster growth of the
        Cardano network in general. But we felt those venues were not really
        suitable for in-depth technical discussions between peer builders, and
        the general content of the proposed sessions and talks was not technical
        enough for the people actually building or trying to build software on
        Cardano.

      <h2 id="a-strong-scientific-background">
        A strong scientific background
      </h2>
      <p>
        At the other end of the spectrum live scientific conferences on
        cryptography, blockchain technology, digital currencies, security, where
        researchers congregate, can present their latest work, and have it
        peer-reviewed. Cardano is renowned for its emphasis on
        <em>first principles</em> and research-based technology as exemplified
        by the
        <a href="https://iohk.io/en/research/library/">numerous papers</a> which
        have been published on and around Cardano.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cardano technology stack has come a long way since the early days of
        Byron, having proven its robustness and versatility. The core network
        has grown to about 3000 active stake pools, tens of thousands of relays,
        full nodes, and wallets, and has been up and running for seven years
        without any major outage. It has also grown in complexity, from a
        &quot;simple&quot; Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant consensus protocol with
        payment-only transactions, to a decentralised computing platform with
        <a href="https://developers.cardano.org/docs/native-tokens/"
          >native tokens</a
        >,
        <a href="https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/"
          >Smart contracts</a
        >
        language,
        <a
          href="https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-network/p2p-networking/"
          >peer-to-peer network</a
        >, sidechains and
        <a
          href="https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/11/03/partner-chains-are-coming-to-cardano/"
          >partner chains</a
        >, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of this core technology stack, a vibrant ecosystem of service
        providers, tools, companies, or open-source projects has grown and keeps
        growing as exemplified by the enduring success of
        <a href="https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11">Catalyst Funds</a>. Yet
        it&#39;s fair to say this growing complexity, along with the
        peculiarites of Cardano&#39;s UTxO model, comes with a steep learning
        curve which the growing body of documentation, training courses, and
        learning material available only partially covers.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bridging-the-gap">Bridging the gap</h2>
      <p>
        As time goes by, we felt the divide in the ecosystem between the
        developers working <em>on</em> Cardano itself on one side, eg. those who
        are designing and building the technological foundations and tools, the
        cardano-node, the ledger, the Plutus language ; and the developers
        working <em>with</em> Cardano on the other side, those who are building
        applications, DEXes, explorers, wallets, was increasing along with the
        complexity of the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Cardano Buidler Fest</em> therefore aims at becoming a recurring
        event that will bridge that gap between various people involved in the
        concrete daily work of working with the Cardano and more generally
        blockchain stack, and provided technology-centric venue to share and
        discuss things that matter when one wants to be involved in building
        Cardano.
      </p>
      <p>
        This first edition will also be a kind of reality check for the
        community of Cardano technologists: How large this community actually
        is? What kind of problems do matter to those people <em>now</em> and in
        the <em>future</em>? How the practical issue of building
        <em>with</em> Cardano can inform the development of the core aspects of
        the network?
      </p>
      <p>
        But Cardano does not live in a vacuum, and we also hope this event will
        attract practitioners from other blockchain ecosystems as we truly think
        the challenges faced by Cardano builders are not unique, and there is
        value in sharing ideas and solutions across ecosystems.

      <h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>
      <p>
        Matthias and I view ourselves as mere &quot;catalysts&quot;: We provide
        a venue, some budget, some planning, and enough energy to make sure the
        news reach most people that we think could be interested, but nothing
        will happen if the community that you are a member of does not step in
        and takes control of the content of the event:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first and best way to help is to come, join us, and share your
          knowledge, passion, vision for Cardano and blockchain technology. If
          you cannot make it, be sure to spread the word!
        </li>
        <li>
          You can of course propose a talk or workshop: No need to be an expert
          to do that, the desire to share and receive feedback in front of a
          welcoming and skilled audience are enough.
        </li>
        <li>
          We don&#39;t have the bandwidth to capture talks but if you have the
          skills and resources to record videos, please reach out!
        </li>
        <li>
          We are of course planning to print t-shirts for the conference but
          again, we don&#39;t have much design skills so if you have ideas and
          resources, come talk to us!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We look forward to meet you in Toulouse!</p>
