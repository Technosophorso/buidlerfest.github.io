        We want Cardano Buidler Fest to be as open an event as possible, to
        provide space and time for interesting conversations to happen and new
        ideas to bloom. While &ldquo;standard&rdquo; conferences provide this
        space and time to some extent, traditionally through social events,
        lunch time and coffee breaks, workshops, the event is still built around
        a few speakers presenting their work or ideas to a crowd of listeners.
        And while the requirements for speaking at smaller scale events like
        Cardano Buidler Fest are not as stringent as prestigious academic
        conferences like say
        <a href="https://icfp24.sigplan.org/">ICFP</a>
        with their rigorous peer-review process and low acceptance rate, we know
        that not everyone feel at ease speaking for forty minutes in front of a
        silent crowd. Whether our ideas not being solidified enough, or not
        feeling entitled to speak as a newcomer, or just plain timidity and
        impostor syndrome kicking in, there&rsquo;s a myriad reasons to just sit
        and listen to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the core of Cardano&rsquo;s values lie the idea that
        <em>everyone</em> should have the means to feel like and actually be an
        active member of the community, that the efficiency of delegation and
        representation should be balanced by the energy of participation and
        empowerment. It therefore seemed important to us that the organisation
        of an event like the Cardano Buidler Fest reflects those values, hence
        the reason why we settled on running one day of the conference following
        the principles of <em>Open Space Technology</em>.

      <h2>What is Open-Space Technology?</h2>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology"
          >Wikipedia</a
        >
        page tells us that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Open space technology (OST) is a method for organizing and running a
          meeting or multi-day conference, where participants have been invited
          in order to focus on a specific, important task or purpose.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        &hellip; which is not particularly enlightening. This method is akin to
        other alternative ways of organising various kinds of meetings, like the
        <a href="https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/">Lean coffee</a>
        to run small meetings,
        <a
          href="https://theworldcafe.com/key-concepts-resources/world-cafe-method/"
          >World caf&eacute;</a
        >
        to break down into smaller groups,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)"
          >Fishbowl</a
        >
        conversation to facilitate discussions with a large number of potential
        participants, or even
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha">PechaKucha</a>
        and other Lightning talks formats.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">Unconference</a>
        is a surrogate and flashier word to denote Open Space conferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of Open-Space is to maximise engagement from all the
        participants by removing or lowering the barriers preventing active
        participation. And the reason why this is important and valuable is
        because it&rsquo;s well-known that one learns and teaches better when
        actively engaged, motivated, and receiving feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        More concretely, an Open Space conference follows a structured agenda:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            It opens with a
            <em>Market place</em> where participants publicly and briefly
            present <em>sessions</em> they are interested in. Note that
            it&rsquo;s not necessary to be an expert in the topic covered by a
            session to propose it, on the contrary,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sessions are roughly scheduled as they are presented on an
            <em>Schedule board</em> with a place and a time slot. It&rsquo;s not
            uncommon that two or more people merge their sessions when
            there&rsquo;s not enough slot available and the topics are close
            enough, or that a slot be split to accomodate for more sessions,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Once the agenda is defined, the actual conference begins and
            sessions take place according to their schedule and following a few
            simple rules:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Whoever comes to a session is the right people</li>
            <li>Whenever it starts is the right time</li>
            <li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</li>
            <li>When it&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s over</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When all sessions are over, all attendants meet again for a
            <em>Closing session</em> which allows people to share some thoughts
            about the overall conference, the sessions they&rsquo;ve attended,
            the fascinating discussions they have been part of&hellip;
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The core principle that should drive the participants of an
        <em>Open Space</em> is called the <em>Law of mobility</em> which states
        that all participants should feel free to leave a session they are not
        contributing to, or for which they have lost interest. This is true even
        if they were the one proposing the session in the first place!
      </p>
      <p>
        There&rsquo;s a lot of variations around this basic canvas, but the
        over-arching principle over such an event is
        <em>Self-organisation</em>.
      </p>
      <h2>This looks weird, is it actually used?</h2>
      <p>
        I have been lucky to be exposed to such kind of
        <em>unconference</em> nearly fifteen years ago and since then, I have
        attended quite a few <em>Open Space</em> events:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://citconf.com/">CitCon</a>
          is a series of conference happening worldwide that&rsquo;s been run
          for 15+ years using Open Spaces principles with a wide array of topics
          around Continuous integration &amp;testing
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://agileopenfrance.com/">Agile Open France</a>
          is another conference happening yearly that&rsquo;s run as Open
          Spaces, with a broad &ldquo;agile&rdquo; focus
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://devopsdays.org/about/">DevOpsDays</a>
          are events ran by communities across the globe that are part Open
          Spaces
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.socrates-conference.de/home">SoCraTes</a>
          conferences are also organized as Open Spaces in Germany, France, UK
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But Open Spaces can be scaled down to smaller teams as we did for the
        <em>Scaling teams</em> at IOG in September 2023, running a 2 days
        workshop with about 15 people.
      </p>
      <h2>What should I expect?</h2>
      <p>
        Open Space conferences are like the fabled
        <em>Spanish tavern</em>: You will dine of whatever you and other people
        bring to eat! So come prepared to be surprised, share your energy and
        enthusiasm for topics and matters you really care about!
