      <h1>Bringing Cardano to Asia: Why Vietnam for Builder Fest</h1>
    </header>

    <article>
      <p>
        In 2024, the first Cardano Builder Fest united builders to explore
        challenges, share ideas, and work together on solutions that push the
        boundaries of what's possible on Cardano.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2025, Cardano Builder Fest #2, taking what we have learned and
        experienced, we're expanding to Asia with more ideas, and a stronger,
        united community.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have considered where would be an ideal location such as Singapore,
        Thailand, Hong Kong or Japan. Asia offers vibrant diversity. After much
        consideration, we have landed on Vietnam to be the ideal choice to the
        next Buidler Fest!
      </p>

      <h2>Here are some of the various reasons:</h2>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Growing Tech scene</h3>
      <p>
        Vietnam is a young country and it's a key hub for skill developers in
        the region. There is a vibrant tech scene and startup ecosystem. As an
        event targeting developers, Vietnam is the ideal choice location to grow
        the Cardano community.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Costs and affordability</h3>
      <p>
        Vietnam offers accessible and cost-effective options for planning a
        cost-effective conference for Asia based developers and international
        travelers.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Cultural Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Vietnam offers a rich and diverse cultural experience, with stunning
        natural landscapes, vibrant cities, and mouthwatering food!
      </p>

      <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        We embarked on planning for Buidler Fest 2025 since October 2024 and had
        faced significant challenges. Notably, countries in the region are still
        establishing regulations and framework with regards to
        blockchain<sup>1</sup>. Therefore, the planning team had to work closely
        with the government to issue the license necessary for Buidler Fest
        2025.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the introduction of National Blockchain Strategy by Vietnam
        government in late Oct 2024<sup>2</sup>, we believe that by working
        closely with the Vietnamese government for Cardano Buidler Fest would
        benefit the ecosystem in the long run.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore after months of preparation, we are proud share that we have
        officially received the licence to run Buidler Fest #2 in Vietnam,
        Danang. We look forward to seeing you there!
      </p>

      <h3>Footnotes:</h3>
      <p><sup>1</sup> Vietnam's Blockchain and Crypto Industry Overview</p>
      <p>
        Currently, Vietnam does not have a specific and comprehensive legal
        framework to regulate the crypto industry. However, there are
        indications that the Vietnamese government has begun researching and
        reviewing regulations in this field, including management, taxation, and
        monitoring of crypto-related activities to ensure transparency and
        accountability.
      </p>

      <h4>Here are some notable updates to date:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>2017:</strong> Cryptocurrency is not recognized as a legal
          payment method, and the use of crypto for payments is prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2018:</strong> The Vietnamese government imposes penalties for
          using crypto in payment transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2019:</strong> The prohibition on the use of crypto in
          individual and organizational transactions is further strengthened.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2020:</strong> Crypto trading and ownership continue to grow
          in Vietnam, though there are no laws regarding crypto ownership. The
          Ministry of Education and Training partners with Viction (formerly
          TomoChain) to digitize and store national diplomas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2021:</strong> Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh calls for

          international position in the blockchain industry by 2030.

        market. Countries like the United States, Canada, Singapore, Japan,

        recognize crypto as a legal asset. Conversely, countries such as China,
        Bangladesh, Pakistan, and some others currently ban crypto. Vietnam
        takes a middle-ground approach, prohibiting the use of crypto as a
        payment method but allowing ownership rights.
