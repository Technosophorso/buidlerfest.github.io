      <p>
        When organizing an event or working on an open-source project, managing
        funds isn't just about balancing a budget, it's about building trust,
        fostering accountability, and ensuring that every decision supports the
        larger vision. In projects like Cardano Buidler Fest, where
        collaboration and transparency are at the heart of everything we do,
        fund management becomes particularly critical.

      <h2>A Practical Tool for Team Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://multisig.meshjs.dev/" target="_blank"
          >Multisig Platform</a
        >
        allows multiple team members to participate in every financial decision.
        Each transaction requires approval from 3 out of 4 parties involved,
        ensuring collective agreement before any funds are spent.

      <h3>Convenience in fund management</h3>
      <p>
        When a team member needs to request the use of funds, they can create a
        new transaction through the web interface. The transaction will only be
        executed once required parties sign for approval.

      />
      <h3>Collective decision making</h3>
      <p>
        Decisions on spending are reviewed and approved collectively by the
        team. This ensures that every allocation is deliberate, purposeful, and
        aligned with the event's goals.

      <h3>Accountability through consensus</h3>
      <p>
        Multisig empowers the team to share responsibility for fund management,
        eliminating individual control and promoting accountability at every
        step.

      <p>
        Any invalid transactions can be easily refunded by the team. It a click
        of a button, the transaction is created and to be signed by the required
        parties.
